# HeLa-Docetaxel-Titan-RNAseq

This repository provides the documentation and metadata for the bulk RNA-sequencing dataset of Docetaxel-induced 'Titan' HeLa cells, revealing engagement of a Therapy-Induced Senescence (TIS) program at the transcriptome level. The dataset is associated with the 2023 *Aging Cell* publication by Belhadj et al. from the Lomakin Lab (https://www.lomakinlab.org/) at Medical University of Vienna, Austria.Â

## ðŸ’¡ Dataset Description Abstract & Key Findings

Chemotherapeutic drugs can induce cellular stress responses that lead to therapy resistance. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional adaptations of HeLa cells to poly(aneu)ploidogenic stress triggered by the taxoid chemotherapeutic agent, Docetaxel (DTX). We found that a single-dose exposure to a clinically-relevant subsaturating concentration of DTX is sufficient to elicit a "Titan" phenotype, characterized by large, polyploid cells.

Bulk RNA-sequencing of these Titan cells revealed a significant engagement of transcriptional programs associated with **Therapy-Induced Senescence (TIS)**. This conclusion is supported by pathway analysis using publicly available tools such as [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/). These findings suggest that TIS at the transcriptome level is a key adaptive response to the genomic stress imposed by Docetaxel, providing insight into potential mechanisms of phenotypic chemo-resistance/-tolerance. This notion is consistent with the recent findings by [Bajtai et al., *Molecular Cancer*, 2025](https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-025-02310-0), describing TIS as a transient drug resistance mechanism in cancer cells.

## ðŸŽ¯ Experimental Design & Methods

The goal of this RNA-sequencing experiment was to test in an unbiased manner whether changes in whole-cell size, nuclear shape, nuclear size, and nuclear abundanceâ€”induced by exposing cells to subsaturating concentrations of the microtubule-targeting agent **Docetaxel (DTX)**â€”would trigger an adaptive transcriptional program consistent with a senescence-like phenotype.

* **Organism:** *Homo sapiens*
* **Cell Line:** HeLa (Kyoto strain)
* **Culture Conditions:** 2D cell culture
* **Experiment:** Cells were either untreated (Control, Day 0) or treated with a single dose of **10 nM Docetaxel for 72 hours** (Day 3).
* **Phenotype Studied:** Induction of large, poly(aneu)ploid "Titan" cells.
* **Replicates:** The experiment was performed in triplicate.
